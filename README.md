# Word_Solver
Word_Solver project is created in Python by defining various functions that load a 4x4 game board based on input, recursively searches in all allowed directions for plausible words using Depth First Traversal, and then prints out the valid words based on length constraints and by cross-checking whether the word exists in the stored dictionary.
